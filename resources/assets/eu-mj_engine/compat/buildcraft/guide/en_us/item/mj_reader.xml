A version of the EU-Reader that can be used to measure MJ flow.
<chapter name="Recipe"/>
<recipes stack="eu-mj_engine:mj_reader"/>

Due to the nature of MJ, the MJ-Reader continuously takes measurements over time, in order to get an average flow rate.
The longer the time taken, the more accurate the reading should be.

Each second the reading will update within the MJ-Reader's GUI, giving a flow rate for each direction.
The direction of the flow is not given, as currently it is not possible to work out.

The MJ-Reader currently only supports kinesis pipes, but should support a wider range of MJ devices over time.
